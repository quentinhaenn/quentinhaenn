# Hello everyone ! ðŸ‘‹ Glad to see you on my GitHub profile !

 Iâ€™m @quentinhaenn, I'm currently a PhD student at the *Laboratory of Computer Science and Automatic Control for Systems* ([Lias](https://www.lias-lab.fr)) !
 I'm pursueing researches in clustering algorithms and the title of my work by now is "Clustering under similarity constraints". I developped several algorithms and benchmarks you can find on my profile !


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in datascience and AI but more widely in any code project that can make people's life easier and smarter, espacially those focusing on ecology and enerfy savings

I ended up with a great masterizing of python, especially through the scientific stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc) and I also developped several extensions in C and C++ embedded in python packages.

I'm always looking for new project to come in,do not hesitate contacting me !
